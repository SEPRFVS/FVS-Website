            <h2>Trains</h2>
            <p>The different types of train increase competition.  Some of the work that needs doing will require a certain train, so there's a trade-off between speed and money to be had.</p>

            <h2>Map</h2>
            <p>With destinations from across Europe included, there's thousands of opportunities for routes which will earn money for the operating companies.  If the connection needed doesn't exist, then it can be built in to help a company achieve its goals.</p>
            <p>Tracks can become blocked by obstacles which will stop trains from running.  This could be a natural problem, a train crash, or the sinister actions of a train company.  Blocked tracks will get fixed over time, but deploying an engineer will speed things along.</p>
            <p>Junctions help trains move around by increasing the number of trains that can run through an area without crashing, so even more can be earned through train movements.</p>

            <h2>Replay</h2>
            <p>Your game is always being recorded so you can instantly start replaying your turns.  Just hit Start Replay and you can jump through to a turn and see your action replayed.</p>
            <p>Replays have an adjustable speed and you can easily specify a range of turns to move through so you can see everything throughout your game.</p>

            <h2>Customisation</h2>
            <p>Your name and the number of turns can be customised in game to let you play on your terms.  You can even enter endless mode if you want to play forever.</p>

                <p>Newspaper and social media feed keep track of in-game events for all to see.  These appear in any replays as well so you'll always know what's going on.</p>
                <p>You'll receive updates on delays, crashes, track additions and more to help you on your way to being the best train company out there.</p>
                <p>The reports will adapt to events in game as well, so you won't always be seeing the same few messages again and again.</p>
