            <h2>The Story of Trains across Europe</h2>
            <p>Back in October 2014, Trains across Europe (TaxE) was proposed by the University of York as the SEPR project for 2014/15.  This concept was developed so that in January a <a href="../assessment2/" title="Assessment 2">first version</a> of it was released.  During the compulsory swap stage it was taken on by 6 teams to be developed further.</p>
            <p>We took on a different project, one designed by <a href="http://www.eurotraingame.co.uk/" title="ADB webiste" target="_blank">ADB</a>, to develop further.  This was extended to be a full implementation of the game and was made available at the end of the <a href="../assessment3/" title="Assessment 3">third assessment</a>.</p>
            <p>Then we took on the game designed in the previous assessment made by DUS, which is based off our assessment 2 submission.  This was then extended to include the new requirements (connection modification and replay) and is now available in a finnished form.</p>
