            <h3>Europe opens railway network to new players</h3>
            <div class="col3">
                <p>European Rail Control have announced plans to allow new companies to enter the european rail market for both freight and passenger transport.  This is the first time we will also see operators running services to both the United Kingdom and mainland Europe in a joined up fashion.</p>
                <img src="res/map1.png" alt="European Train Network Map" />
                <p>To give any new company a helping hand, Rail Control have prommised to provide a selection of trains to all new operators in return for assistance in track maintainance and additions.  Rail Control will maintain some assistance with track management but expect, for the most part, it will be conducted by these new companies.</p>
                <p>It has been said that this will likely lead to a complete saturation of the market, and as such there will be increased safety risks as well as more trains in operation than a needed.  Previous trends suggest that half of all companies that enter the market will go bust due to their rivals outperforming them.</p>
                <p>Social media commentator, and over-enthusiastic train enthusiast, Dwile Flonking said <q>I'm excited to see what will happen with this.  This could literally go in any direction.  Will there be #delays? Will there be a #crash?  We'll have to wait and see.</q></p>
