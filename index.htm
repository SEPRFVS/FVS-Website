            <p>TaxE is the latest, and first, game from Team FVS.  A story of great suspense, tragedy and jubilance as you must step up and become a train company.  Your rivals will try to beat you and leave you with nowhere left to run but you must ensure your transportation empire prevails.  Using all the trains at your disposal you need to travel across Europe to get your train to the most destinations in the time you have.  Your main competitor won't stand still, so play now to make sure you're on top.</p>

            <p>You can travel across Europe to get your trains to their destination as quickly as possible.  With stations in over 25 countries there are hundreds of possibilities as to what you can do.  Your main competitor operates across the same network so you'll need to make sure your trains are the fastest and taking the best route possible to ensure that they reach the destination first.  The player who completes the most goals wins, so you need to make sure that you're keeping on top.</p>
            <img src="res/screenshot1.png" class="midshot left" alt="Train Map from TaxE" />
            <h3>Game Map</h3>
            <p>There are stations and junctions across over 25 european countries, giving you hundreds of possible routes you can take.  The realistic map of the continent makes it easy to find the station you need, whilst the abstraction of the train lines makes it easy to understand just how long each journey will take when paired with the abilities of each train you use.</p>
            <p>Stations have infinite capacity so you don't need to worry about where the other player has as their final destination, unless you're on a collision course.  All trains sit at a platform so it's easy to pick your train out from the station and give the driver instructions of where his next adventure will be to.</p>
            <p>Play the game to explore all the destinations!</p>
            <img src="res/screenshot2.png" class="midshot right" alt="Station Options from TaxE" />
            <h3>Trains</h3>
            <p>There are 10 different train types in game and upto 14 trains traveling around at any one time, so strategy with your trains is key to your success.  Different trains travel at different speeds so some will reach destinations faster than others, so if it doesn't matter what train you send then choosing the right train to make it fastest is key.</p>
            <p>Trains don't last forever though.  Once your train has made it to it's final destination it leaves you to go off on a new and exciting adventure.  You can also choose to let the trains you have go that you no longer need, so strategy is key to maintaing not only the fastest fleet around, but the fleet you need to meet the demands set by your client.</p>
            <p>Meet all the trains in game now!</p>
            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>There are many different types of goals, and just like in the real world transprtation game, you rarely get the same task twice.  Sometimes you just need to get from one station to another, but at others you need to make sure the right type of train arrives, otherwise you'll have to do it all over again.</p>
            <p>Your strategy is key to being prepared for these goals.  Will you keep the fastest trains ready to respond to the majority of goals, or will you keep some less good trains in reserve so you can beat your competitor when the harder goals arrive?  The choice is up to you, but you need to be ready for anything in TaxE.</p>
            <img src="res/screenshot3.png" class="midshot left" alt="Train Map from TaxE" />
            <h3>Routing</h3>
            <p>Not every station is connected to every other station, there is a complex network of twists, turns, stations and junctions to negotiate.  You need to get your train there the fastest way, but which is it?  It's easy to build up a route and make it to your target destination so long as you have the right train to hand.</p>
            <p>Be careful though!  You can never have 2 trains at a junction.  You don't want to run the risk of coming a cropper and seeing your and your competitors trains destroyed in a horrific crash, or do you?  Strategy is key to predicitng your opponents moves and remembering what they're already doing.  It's down to you, though, if you use this power for good or evil.</p>
